# ðŸŽ¨ Daily UI Challenge  

This repository contains my builds for the **Daily UI Challenge**.  
Each day, I build a new UI design/code based on the given prompt.  

## ðŸ“… Progress  
Iâ€™ll keep adding prompts and my builds here every day as I move forward with the challenge.  

## ðŸ”— Also on CNC  
Iâ€™m also posting these builds on my Instagram [@codeandcanvas.dev](https://instagram.com/codeandcanvas.dev) as well â€” check them out there in highlights!
